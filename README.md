INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
=============================================================

1. Description:
----------------
This is a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python and the Scapy library. The IDS captures network packets, handles different protocols, and performs further analysis to detect potential intrusions.

2. Dependencies:
-----------------
- Python 3.x
- Scapy library: Install using `pip install scapy`

3. Code Structure:
------------------
The code is organized into the following functions:

- setup_socket():
    - Sets up the socket to listen for incoming network traffic.
    - Configures the socket to capture raw packets with IP headers.

- analyze_traffic(socket):
    - Analyzes the captured network traffic for intrusions.
    - Implements the intrusion detection logic.
    - Takes appropriate actions if an intrusion is detected.

- cleanup_socket(socket):
    - Cleans up resources and closes the socket.

- main():
    - Entry point of the program.
    - Calls the necessary functions to start the IDS.

4. Usage:
----------
- Customize the 'packet_handler()' function to implement your own intrusion detection logic.
- Set the appropriate network interface in the 'main()' function (e.g., 'eth0' for Ethernet).
- Run the script using the Python interpreter (e.g., `python3 intrusion_detection.py`).

5. Customization:
------------------
- Implement your intrusion detection logic inside the 'packet_handler()' function.
- Access packet attributes using the Scapy library (e.g., packet.summary(), packet[TCP].payload, etc.).
- Add further analysis, anomaly detection algorithms, or machine learning techniques to enhance the intrusion detection capabilities.

6. Additional Considerations:
-----------------------------
- This code provides a basic starting point for an IDS and can be extended according to specific requirements.
- Ensure proper permissions and privileges to capture network traffic.
- Consider system performance and scalability when analyzing a large volume of packets.
